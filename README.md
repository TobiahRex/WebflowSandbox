# _WebflowSandbox:_
Created: 18 June 2017

## DESCRIPTION:
Sandbox testing out Webflow API endpoints for finding a workflow between designer and developer.

<!-- ## Setup:
  - `npm i` to install dependencies
  - touch a ".env" file and add 3 variables
    * BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000/
    * DEPLOY_URL=(your deployed url)
    * NODE_ENV=development
      - WARNING: You will not successfully spin up the app without doing this step.
  - `npm start` for development server
    * Once the "webpack built xxxxxx..." message appears (May take a few moments) the app will start.
  - `npm run build` for production server
    * This command will automatically change the NODE_ENV env variable to "production" and set off a chain of events for creating a bundle for production.


  NOTE: I Highly recommend running `npm update --save` to update package json before running `npm start` or `npm build`. -->
